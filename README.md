# Mean-Arterial-Pressure
Here's a Python code for calculating the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) including all parameters in actual condition:
After defining the function, the code prompts the user to enter the values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It then calls the calculate_map function with the provided inputs and stores the result in the map variable.

Finally, it displays the calculated MAP to the user. The MAP is typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), which is the standard unit for blood pressure.
