# Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) Calculator

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) based on systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. The MAP is an important measure used in clinical settings to assess the average blood pressure within the arteries during a cardiac cycle.

## Introduction
Blood pressure is a vital sign that provides information about the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It is typically measured using two values: systolic blood pressure (the maximum pressure during a heartbeat) and diastolic blood pressure (the minimum pressure between heartbeats). While these values are important, they do not provide a comprehensive picture of the overall blood pressure during a cardiac cycle.

The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is a calculated value that represents the average pressure within the arteries throughout the cardiac cycle. It is often considered a better indicator of tissue perfusion and organ function compared to systolic or diastolic blood pressure alone. MAP is particularly relevant in critical care settings, as it helps healthcare professionals monitor and manage patients' cardiovascular health.

## Mean Arterial Pressure
The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is calculated using the following formula:

```
MAP = (2 * diastolic_bp + systolic_bp) / 3
```

where `systolic_bp` represents the systolic blood pressure and `diastolic_bp` represents the diastolic blood pressure.

The MAP is expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), which is the standard unit for blood pressure measurements.

## Usage
To use this script, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine

### Running the Script
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `calculate_map.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python calculate_map.py
   ```

4. Enter the systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) when prompted and press Enter.
5. Enter the diastolic blood pressure (in mmHg) when prompted and press Enter.
6. The script will calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) using the provided values and display the result.

   Example output:
   ```
   Enter the systolic blood pressure (mmHg): 120
   Enter theastolic blood pressure (mmHg): 80
   The Mean Arial Pressure (MAP) is: 93.33333333333333 mmHg
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully calculated the Mean Arterial Pressure () using the provided Python script.
